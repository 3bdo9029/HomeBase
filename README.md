# 🏠 HomeBase — Periodic Home Task Tracker

## Elevator Pitch
HomeBase is a simple, collaborative web application that helps households keep track of recurring home maintenance tasks—like **changing air filters**, cleaning dryer vents, testing smoke detectors, and replacing water filters—so nothing gets forgotten. By centralizing periodic tasks and showing real-time updates when tasks are completed, HomeBase turns home maintenance into an easy, shared routine.
